## Project Overview
Protect your planet by shooting the meteor showers that are heading towards you!
Meteor showers come in waves and each meteor drops scraps that you use to upgrade your health, bullet speed, and gun type between waves. 
See how long you can survive!

## Project Background
Created for Mini Jam 174: Defense. The limitation was "Only one resource", and I decided for the scraps to be the one resource.
I still have more ideas to implement which I plan on doing in the coming weeks.

## Project Experience
This game was created in Godot. This was the first ever game I created on my own. All the ideas came from me, while the art I got from free assets
that are credited in game. Through the use of online tutorials and my own dedication and problem solving, I was able to create a game that I'm proud of. 
It was a good first dive into Godot and got me familiar with the game engine and made me confident in my ability to create.
